    "\n",
    "This project aims to select the safest place in Denver based on the number of crimes, explore the neighborhoods of the location to find the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood and finally cluster the neighborhoods using k-mean clustering.\n",
    "This report will be targeted to people who are looking to relocate to Denver. \n",
    "When people relocate from one location to another location, their top concern is safety in their apartment and neighborhood. If you don’t feel safe in your location, you will not be able to enjoy living there. The crime statistics will provide an insight into this issue.\n",
    "We will focus on the safest neighborhood and the 10 most common venues in each neighborhood so that the best neighborhood suited to an individual's needs can be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data \n",
    "Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decision are:\n",
    " The total number of crimes commited in each of the borough during the last year.\n",
    " The most common venues in each of the neighborhood in the safest borough selected.\n",
    " Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:\n",

    "#### Results and Discussion \n",
    "The aim of this project is to help people who want to relocate to the safest neighborhood in Denver, expats can chose the neighborhoods to which they want to relocate based on the most common venues in it. \n",
    "For example if a person is looking for a neighborhood with good connectivity and public transportation we can see that Cluster 2 has the most common venues. If a person is looking for a neighborhood with stores and sports centers in a close proximity then the neighborhoods in the third cluster is suitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion \n",
    "This project helps a person get a better understanding of the neighborhoods with respect to the most common venues in that neighborhood. It is always helpful to make use of technology to stay one step ahead i.e. finding out more about places before moving into a neighborhood. We have just taken safety as a primary concern to shortlist the Neighborhoods of Denver. The future of this project includes taking other factors such as cost of living in the areas into consideration to shortlist the neighborhoods based on safety and a predefined budget."
